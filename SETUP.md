# Quick Setup Guide

## ðŸš€ Next Steps to Get Your Vet Medication Calculator Running

### 1. Set up Supabase Database

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Once created, go to **Settings > API** and copy:
   - Project URL
   - Anon (public) key
   - Service role key (keep this secret!)

3. Create `.env.local` file in your project root:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key_here
```

### 2. Create Database Tables

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Copy the entire contents of `supabase-schema.sql` 
3. Paste and run it in the SQL editor
4. This will create all tables, security policies, and sample medications

### 3. Test Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 and you should see:
- âœ… Medication calculator interface
- âœ… Sample medications loaded
- âœ… Authentication working
- âœ… Dosage calculations working

### 4. Deploy to Vercel

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and import your repository
3. Add the same environment variables from step 1
4. Deploy!
